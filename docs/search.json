    "text": "1.1 History\nThe idea of grouping things has existed for the longest of time in the history of the Modern Homo Sapiens specie. The study of grouping objects was later called set theory, where a set is a collection/grouping of objects. The study of modern set theory is often attributed to one of its founders, a prominent German mathematician—George Cantor along with another German mathematician Richard Dedekind, which they developed in the 1870s.\nAs the topic was relatively new and hot at the time, it received backlashes often from older mathematicians who did not embrace new idea. A famous mathematician and philosopher, Bertrand Russell also attacked some of these ideas which gave birth to a concepts like Russell’s Paradoxes or fuzzy set theory.",

    "text": "1.2 Applications\nYatla | UNDER CONSTRUCTION\nHowever, as I’ve outline that this isn’t a new idea, you have also used sets in your daily life. Formally, a\n\nSET\n\nis a collection of objects or elements. A set is often denoted with a capital letter & curly braces.\n\n\nThese objects are also called members. A classroom is a set made of students, and these students are the members of this set. In that same classroom, we can have a set which consists of only boys. Remember that the art of grouping can group things that have similarities or are entirely different. The classroom set has both girls and boys. The similarity is that they’re all human. The set grouping all boys in that classroom share the similarity being that they’re boys, but they’re most likely different in many other ways, from names to their Blood Pressure. A set is often denoted with a capital letter & curly braces , while the elements are denoted by small letters .Let \\[\nV = \\{𝑎,𝑒,𝑖,𝑜,𝑢\\}\n\\] Be an example where the set \\(V\\) is the set of all vowels. Where \\(𝑎,𝑒,𝑖,𝑜,𝑢\\) are the members of the set \\(V\\). The curly braces means “the set of”. Since \\(u\\) and \\(a, 𝑒,𝑖, 𝑜,𝑢\\) are elements of \\(V\\), we denote it as \\(u𝜖V\\) and \\[(𝑎,𝑒,𝑖,𝑜,𝑢)𝜖V ≡ 𝑎,𝑒,𝑖,𝑜,𝑢𝜖V\\]\nRespectively. It oath to be noted that the order of elements in the set and repetition are not important, thus a set with elements \\[\\{𝑜, 𝑒, 𝑢,𝑎,𝑖\\}\\] and \\[\\{𝑎,𝑎,𝑖,𝑖,𝑖,𝑖,𝑖,𝑜,𝑢,𝑒,𝑒\\} \\] Are the same as the set \\(V\\). The number of elements within a set are referred to as a Cardinality, denoted by the absolute bars \\(|𝑋|\\) where \\(X\\) is a set. Thus the cardinality of the set of vowels \\(𝑉\\) is \\(5\\) denoted \\[|V| = 5\\].\nAnother simple example would be as follows, lets call it the Black Box example :\nSuppose you have a Black Box in a class, then ask each and every student to put a paper inside of the box(more like voting). The papers could be different colors and shapes, or just all plain White square papers.\nThe Box will act as a set while the papers of the students inside the box are regarded as the elements of the set(or elements of the box). If the box was empty, then we’d say the box is an empty set/null set. This is a special case of a set and it is denoted by\n\\(\\phi\\) or empty curly braces \\(\\{\\}\\). In turn, \\(\\phi = \\{\\}\\) with a cardinality of \\(0\\).",

One of the earliest encounters could be seen around 5th BCE where the famous Greek philosopher Zeno of Elea introduced a number of problems where only Nine survived, which came to be known as Zeno’s Paradoxes, these were his proposals to the questions concerning space and time at their time.\nOn one of them, Zeno argued that a man who wanted to walk across a room, had to walk half the distance of the room first, but before travelling that distance they had to travel halfway of that half, then half of that, and repeatedly infinitely many times producing the sequence \\[\n...,\\frac{1}{16},\\frac{1}{8},\\frac{1}{4},\\frac{1}{2},1\n\\]\nWhich he claimed was impossible since it requires a number of infinite tasks and wouldn’t have the first distance to travel, meaning the journey wouldn’t even start. Traveling across the same room would give the sequence \\[\n1,\\frac{1}{2},\\frac{1}{4},\\frac{1}{8},\\frac{1}{16},...,\\frac{1}{2^n}\n\\]",

In Chemistry it is used to see how chemical reactions end, in Statistics it is used to study trends, in ecology and epidemiology it is used to model populations of the same and different species. In astronomy and cosmology it is used to study the emission of radiation/energy of celestial bodies; and it is used by TikTok and Netflix to recommend you videos and movies you may like.\nFirst and foremost, what’s the difference between a sequence and a series?",
